# EcommercePlatformForSmallBusinesses_Retail

## Introduction

My project is called LocalKart, an e-commerce platform made for small businesses. The main purpose of this project is to help local sellers take their business online and reach more customers. Many small vendors don’t have the resources or technical knowledge to create a website or app, so this platform makes it easy for them to list and manage their products without any hassle.

On the platform, sellers can log in to their own dashboard where they can add new products, edit existing ones, and even sort or search through their listings. For customers, there’s a user-friendly dashboard where they can browse all available products, search by category or name, add items to a wishlist, and shop by adding products to their cart. Once ready, they can place an order directly from the site.

This project aims to solve the real-world problem of helping small businesses go digital, manage their products easily, and connect with customers who prefer online shopping.
