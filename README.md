# EcommercePlatformForSmallBusinesses
EcommercePlatformForSmallBusinesses is a web-based e-commerce platform built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase, created to empower small business owners by giving them a simple yet powerful way to sell their products online.

The platform allows vendors to sign up, manage product listings, fulfill orders, create promotions, and customize their own storefronts. At the same time, customers can browse products by category, search and filter items, add to cart, securely checkout, track their orders, and leave product reviews.

The project aims to provide a complete online selling and buying experience tailored to small businesses, without the need for complex or expensive software.
